# Hi, welcome to my GitHub! üëãüèΩ

At the heart of my brand is a passion for continuous learning and growth. I have always been drawn to problem-solving and finding innovative solutions, which is why I have recently made the transition from Mortgage Underwriting to Software Development. I am excited to bring my skills and experience to this new field, and to continue building my expertise in order to create meaningful and impactful technology for others.
